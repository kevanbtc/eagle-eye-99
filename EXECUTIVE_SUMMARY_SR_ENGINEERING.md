### Trade Secret Portfolio

Top-secret IP assets (not patentable, but defensible):
- Rule parametrization database (IRC/IECC/NEC mappings)
- Regional economic factors model (ZIP-code-level pricing)
- Vision model fine-tuning data (construction plan datasets)
- MCP tool handler optimization patterns

**Protection**: NDA agreements, encryption, access control, audit logging

## TECHNOLOGY DECISIONS ✅ CORRECT FOR PRODUCTION

| Component | Technology | Why | Production Ready |
|-----------|-----------|-----|-----------------|
| Backend | FastAPI (Python) | Type-safe, async native, ML-friendly | ✅ |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 | ACID, relational integrity, standard | ✅ |
| Frontend | Next.js 14 (TypeScript) | React best-practices, SSR, type-safe | ✅ |
| Containerization | Docker Compose → Kubernetes | Local dev easy, production scalable | ✅ |
| Agents | MCP (Model Context Protocol) | Standardized agent tool spec | ✅ |
| Audit Trail | IPFS | Immutable, distributed, forensic-grade | ✅ |
| Type Safety | Pydantic v2 | Validation, serialization, JSON schema | ✅ |

---

## COMPETITIVE MOAT: 7/10 DEFENSIBILITY

| Factor | Score | Why | Effort to Replicate |
|--------|-------|-----|---------------------|
| Patents | 8/10 | 3 novel patents covering ML+rules, parametric engine, IPFS | 2-3 years |
| Trade Secrets | 9/10 | Rule DB, economic models, training data | Very high |
| Brand | 6/10 | EAGLE EYE™ emerging but distinctive | 6-12 months |
| Network Effects | 5/10 | Early-stage, but switching costs high | 1-2 years |
| Code Complexity | 8/10 | Multi-service microservices, async patterns | 1-2 years |
