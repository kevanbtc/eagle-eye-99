- Guarantees 30-90 day retention (IPFS nodes can garbage-collect)
- Provides HTTP gateway for easy verification
- Includes cryptographic proofs of pinning

**Implementation**:

```python
import requests

class PinataGateway:
    """
    Pinata service for IPFS redundancy and long-term storage.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, jwt_token: str):

            headers=self.headers,
            json=data
        )
        return response.json()
    
    def verify_pin_status(self, cid: str) -> dict:
        """

        """
        response = requests.get(
            f"{self.base_url}/data/pinList?hashContains={cid}",
            headers=self.headers

                "replicas": pins[0]["regions"],
                "status": "GUARANTEED"
            }
        return {"pinned": False, "status": "NOT_PINNED"}
```

### 5.3 Legal & Regulatory Implications of IPFS

**Advantages**:
- Immutable record for regulatory audits (EPA, local building dept)
- Tamper-proof chain-of-custody for insurance claims
- Decentralized storage = no single point of failure
- Cryptographic proof of analysis completion

**Challenges**:
- GDPR right-to-be-forgotten conflicts with immutability
  - **Solution**: PII redaction before IPFS pinning
  
- Data retention compliance varies by jurisdiction
  - **Solution**: Document retention policy (30-90 days standard)
  
- Blockchain/IPFS regulation still evolving
  - **Solution**: Consult legal before production use

**Recommended Approach**:
- Pin findings WITHOUT PII (project ID instead of client names)
- Maintain separate encrypted PII database
- Document IPFS usage in Terms of Service
- Enable user opt-out of IPFS pinning if desired

## PART 8: COMPETITIVE MOAT & IP DEFENSIBILITY

### 8.1 What Makes Eagle Eye Defensible

**Strong IP Moats**:
1. ✅ **Rule Parametrization** (Trade Secret)
   - IRC/IECC/NEC rules with jurisdiction context
   - Difficulty: 2-3 years to replicate

2. ✅ **Regional Economic Model** (Trade Secret)
   - Labor/material factors by ZIP code
   - Difficulty: High (requires market data collection)

3. ✅ **Patent Portfolio** (Utility Patents)
   - Autonomous compliance system
   - Multi-jurisdiction rule engine
   - IPFS audit trails

4. ✅ **Brand** (Trademark)
   - EAGLE EYE™ distinctive mark
   - Market recognition

5. ✅ **Network Effects** (Strategic)
   - Lender database integration
   - GC/contractor preference once established
   - Switching costs (historical project data)

### 8.2 Defensibility Score

| Factor | Score | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Patent Quality | 7/10 | Good but blockchain patents face prior art |
| Trade Secrets | 9/10 | High value, hard to replicate |
| Code Complexity | 8/10 | Multi-service microservices architecture |
| Brand Strength | 6/10 | Strong but emerging market |
| Market Position | 5/10 | Early-stage, but first-mover in agentic construction |
| **Overall** | **7/10** | **Moderately Strong** |
