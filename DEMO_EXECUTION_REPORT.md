## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

### Option 1: Run Live Demo Again
```powershell
python demo.py
```
This demonstrates the system works without Docker/WSL issues.

### Option 2: Deploy with Docker (When WSL is fixed)
```powershell
.\deploy.ps1 local
```
This launches 10 services with full web UI.

### Option 3: Test with Different Project
Modify `demo.py` and run with custom client/project data.
